              <h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
                <strong>We provide the &quot;missing communication&quot; for connecting the public to policies about [carding] in a creative&nbsp;way.</strong>
                <br><br>
                <p>To facilitate community&#8209;led discussion regarding racial profiling in order to disrupt and dismantle the practice of [carding]. With focus on helping the public have the resources and tools to equip themselves  with the foresight to hold municipalities and police&nbsp;accountable.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4><a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/street-checks?_ga=1.55454828.658612006.1487263514" target="_blank">Learn about the policy</a></h4>
                <p>This year the Ontario government announced new relegations of controversial practice of carding &ndash; which is now known as [ regulated interactions]. Officially known as the Community Contacts Policy, carding allows police officers to detain, question, and store personal information about individual people's addresses; without ever arresting the&nbsp;individual. </p><br><br>
                <h6>27.4% of carding incidents in Toronto was involving Black males (while Black people represent 8.1% of the population in&nbsp;Toronto).</h6>

            <section id="why" class="scene">
              <h3>WHY THIS MATTERS</h3>
                <p>Since the introduction of the regulation being implemented there has been very little information and understanding developed by the government nor by the Toronto police for the public and those who are most vulnerable to the practice, to know the policy and their rights. A policy that has been reported to be [harmful no matter what regulations] were imposed. Many rights organizations argue there are still [deep problematic gaps in preventing racial&nbsp;profiling].</p>
              <br><br>
                 ...which are summarized in this [report]
            </section>
            <section id="who" class="scene">
              <h3>WHO WE ARE </h3>
                <p>
                We’re centered on creating accountability and transparency at an early stage to black communities on how data is being collected and highlighting [police behaviour] within their communities. We collaborate with educators, lawyers, designers and advocates to make educational tools to demystify these&nbsp;policies.</p>

              <h4>What makes us different:</h4>

                <p>There are fears expressed by many rights groups that official stop&#8209;and&#8209;search data regarding carding will be misunderstood by the public, used only to satisfy the Ontario government’s mandate for its evaluation on the policy. As stated on (Collection of Identifying information in certain circumstance &ndash; Prohibition and duties, Part 2), the public will have access to limited data curated by the Toronto Police. Their obligation to the policy is to address discrimination and doesn’t touch on matters of policing behaviour, community relationship or preventive measures of racial profiling within black or marginalized communities. Limited information has been given to understand how this data is going to be used within their&nbsp;process.</p>
            <br><br>
            <strong>It starts with Accountability, so we’re developing a&nbsp;Platform:</strong><br><br>
            <p><ul>
                <li>To inform the conversations and disputes that come up between police and&nbsp;communities.</li>
                <li>Understand root causes of the disparities that we&nbsp;observe.</li>
                <li>Establish dialogue on policy and its adverse effects or benefits to the community by leveraging open source&nbsp;data.</li>
                <li>Inspire social change by merging data and transparency through collaboration to promote&nbsp;awareness.</li>
